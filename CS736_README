Getting Started

To compile Bourbon, cmake (>= 3.7) is required. You may follow the instructions on this website to
download and install cmake.

https://cmake.org/install/

After installing cmake, you can compile Bourbon via the following:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake /path/to/bourbon -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DNDEBUG_SWITCH=ON
make -j
```


Code

Bourbon is modified upon LevelDB (https://github.com/google/leveldb) and WiscKey. Most added code
resides in the directory `mod/`. In addition, you may see some code changes in other directories
here and there.

`read_cold` is an application that we use to measure the performance. You may run it with `--help`
to view all options and their descriptions. We list some important ones here. However, please note
that we **strongly** encourage you to write your own application to run your experiments.

-m: running mode. We keep a Wisckey baseline mode inside the library as well for ease of testing.
    "-m 8" is Wisckey and "-m 7" is Bourbon.

-u: unlimited file descriptor. Baseline Wisckey (and LevelDB) assumes the system allows only
    1024 opened file descriptors for a process at the same time, so it hardcode its file 
    descriptor cache size to this value. We find it affect performance much with limited file 
    descriptors so we unlimit file descriptor to at most 65536 with option "-u". The machine 
    for artifact review has been configured to have unlimited file descriptor and please use 
    this option for testing.

-w: Use this option to perform a load.

-l: "-l 0" (default) means ordered loads and "-l 3" means random loads.

-i: number of iterations. Usually we use "-i 5" and use the average latency.

-n: number of requests (in thousands) in one iteration.

-f: the path to the dataset. The dataset file should contain one key per line.

-d: the path to the database. If with "-w" mode, this directory will be created or cleaned if
    already exists.

--distribution: the path to the request distribution file. A distribution file should contain
    one number "x" per line which indicate the x-th key in the dataset file

--YCSB: the path to the YCSB trace file. A YCSB trace file should contain two number "m x" per
    line, where m=0 means get and m=1 means put and x indicate the x-th key in the dataset file.

-k, -v: the size of keys and values, in bytes.

-c: cold read. With this option, before the workload the memory of the machine is cleared so 
    that the database resides on the disk. Use this only if you have sudo access without 
    entering a password.

--change_level_load: This option will disable using existing level models. Using this option
    will test on Sazerac-File (which is what we report), otherwise Sazerac-Level.

To interpret the output results, please check the last few lines of the output.
Internal
- Timer 0: file lookup time within one level, version_set.cc
- Timer 1: file reading time, table_cache.cc
- Timer 2: file model inference time, table_cache.cc
- Timer 3: key search time in file - first search
- Timer 5: key search time in file - rest time
- TImer 12: Value reading time
- Timer 14: value read from memtable or immtable
- Timer 15: FilteredLookup time

- Timer 6: Total key search time given files
- Timer 13 is the total time, which is the time we report.
- Timer 4 is the total time for all get requests.
- Timer 10 is the total time for all put requests.
- Timer 7 is the total compaction time.
- Timer 11 is the total file model learning time.
- Timer 8 is the total level learning time
- timer 9: Total fresh write time (db load)
- timer 16: time to compact memtable

WorkloadEvent level_get, file_get, baseline_get, success_get, false_get, num_compaction, num_learn, read_time, write_time

We have provided some scripts under `scripts/` for artifact reviews. Feel free to take a look at
them to figure out how we ran our experiments. In any case, we still recommend you write your
own application.

Bourbon needs to be re-compiled with additional flags on for mixed workloads (workloads with reads
and writes). Re-compile with the following:
```
cd build
rm -rf *
cmake /path/to/bourbon -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
    -DNDEBUG_SWITCH=ON -DLEVEL_SWITCH=ON -DINTERNAL_TIMER_SWITCH=ON
make -j
```
